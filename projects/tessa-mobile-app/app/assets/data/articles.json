With Engagis’ help, the Convenience giant was seeking to understand the best technology available and to ensure delivery of tailored promotions to the right person, at the right time in order to drive conversions. Ultimately, this personalised messaging would drive  sales in higher profit margin products and help deliver a substantial ROI.</span></p><h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #3d3d3d;background-color: #ffffff;\">What did they change?</span></h4><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #3d3d3d;background-color: #ffffff;\">In collaboration with Data Science firm Harris Partners, Engagis conducted a thorough Test and Learn program across a number of 7-Eleven sites to measure the effectiveness of a range of in store digital solutions.  These digital solutions included digital signage, interactive screens and dynamic, personalised content. Digital signage included small format on shelf displays as well as large format menu boards behind the counter.  Small format interactive touch screens were also deployed at the point of purchase to drive impulse sales.</span></p><h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #3d3d3d;background-color: #ffffff;\">How has it worked out?</span></h4><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #3d3d3d;background-color: #ffffff;\">After a number of control stores were analysed against the “enhanced digital store”, 7-Eleven saw clear and quantifiable lifts in sales directly from the content and promotions across the digital signage, interactive screens and content. Upon completion of the Test And Learn program, 7-Eleven awarded Engagis the rollout of the most effective solutions, after experiencing up to 400% increase in sales on some promoted product lines.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"></p>",

Solutions include digital video walls for Apple products, tech bars to engage, media fountains to entertain, as well as virtual aisles and interactive digital tickets to inform customers. All interactions come together via analytics which help deliver ROI and provide critical data to Telstra.</span></p><h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">How has it worked out?</span></h4><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Engagis’s partnership with Telstra has been the platform for the telco retailer’s in store success and innovation in recent years.

With just a tap of the items on the digital kiosks in-store, a personalised brochure is created. As each card is uniquely coded, the brochure will be available online for the customer to access and review. Moreover, completing the transaction can be done at their own convenience.

Engagis applied its 12 years of experience creating digital point-of-sale displays for the quick-service environment to roll-out a vibrant suite of digital menu boards to coincide with 10 additional stores opening in Sydney and Brisbane. </span></p><h4 dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">How has it worked out?</span></h4><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Although digital menu boards can be more complicated than static ones, the right combination of hardware, software and management has generated an excellent result for GYG.

     "description": "<p><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">It’s a well known fact that successful websites, blogs and social media networks attribute their popularity to having the right content at the right time. Content also takes the crown of the digital signage world. The best digital signage intentions can be lost without the right choice in content to display the right message at any location at any desired time. Let’s take a look at 5 must haves for making content a success across your digital signage network.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">1. A Content Management System Which Can Be Managed Remotely</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">The use of a cloud based content management system should be the first priority in managing digital signage content. A great content management system allows content to be automatically scheduled, ensuring targeted and relevant advertising and compliance across hundreds of store locations, as well as the ability to showcase multiple promotions on a single day , and a single screen. A content management system with the ability to schedule content based on time, day, date or region is the most essential step in making content scalable across a network of stores.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">2. Analytics</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Insightful analytics build the platform for testing and learning from each and every message promoted across a digital sign. Not only do analytics provide insights into dwell time, engagement levels and view time;  they also enable the content to be intuitive as to the demographics of the customer such as gender, age, and even the weather outside. The result is a continuously improved and more personalised message which will ultimately lead to better engagement for you and your customers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">3. Call To Action</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Much like any effective marketing campaign, content for digital signage needs a clear call to action. The best designed content can become nothing more than wall art without an effective purpose which provides the audience with a perception of value and a clear call to action.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">4. Attention Grabbing Visuals</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Once you have established a clear and compelling call to action, it’s time to start having some fun with the actual content that is going to be displayed. The visuals must be dynamic and attention grabbing, to ensure higher attraction and engagement levels with the customer. It is important to remember that digital signage is another touch point of your marketing mix and therefore the imagery and design should be kept clear and consistent with your other advertising and branding platforms.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">5. Is The Content Entertaining, Informative Or Educational</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Your message will either be entertaining, informational or educational and the first step is to determine which one of these three traits your message should be; and then ensure that the message you produce addresses it’s intended purpose. Having an amusing animation might be great fun, but if it doesn’t meet your objective of being informative, the effect on the customer may not be as intended.</span></p><p></p>",

However, before all these, there exists a device that has been a game changer and sits right in our pockets–the mobile phone. Now, they can be partners in giving a more personal customer experience.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">You might start wondering how this is possible. Here, let’s do a bit of dissection.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"><b>Collaboration</b></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Companies that use digital signage can now interact with audience through a unique connection. With the partnership of the digital signage in-store and the customer’s mobile device, a personalized content is displayed. This is processed by the smart device within the screen that gets data from the customer’s mobile device to tailor-fit content according to interests.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"><b>Personalised messages</b></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Using digital signage with a beacon latched onto a nearby customer’s smartphone, brands can now deliver targeted messages. This way, the experience is altered for the better.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">For example, a young lady steps into a store, is identified by a beacon, which then prompts informative content to her phone: women’s shoes and bags that have discounts at the moment. Companies can now feed the consumers with information that are relevant. With this, it creates a touchpoint where consumers feel their needs, which the company has solutions to.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"> The information elicited by the beacon is then gathered and can be accessed by the company.

Would you want to make a purchase? Or, if you just had to at the moment, would you come back? The answer is a “No.”</span><!--StartFragment--></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Compare that experience to being welcomed by a sales staff into a furniture shop that smells like coffee as the door swings open and having the luxury of trying their products. Plus, staff are always in sight whenever you call for help. Ain’t that delightful?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">The two are obviously apart from each other, in the way that they give two opposing experiences to customers. As the first situation presents an industry that provides what customers need a lot, it makes them </span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"><i>unfireable</i></span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">, which means that they</span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"><i> can’t</i></span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"> leave. Meanwhile, in the second situation, it drives customers in by making them feel wanted, which makes the business </span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"><i>unleavable</i></span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Between the two, the better option is to be </span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"><i>unleaveable</i></span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">. Here are the only two things you need to do that, according to Jason Forest of <a href=\"Entrepreneur.com\" target=\"\">Entrepreneur.com</a>.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">1. Create what your customers love</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">The reason why you have customers is that you make their lives better. Whether you offer a product or service, they must feel that you are dependable. So, it’s high time to let your best foot forward and throw mediocrity out the window.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Don’t give them what they don’t want. Rather, get them to trust you more. Give them the best experience, like taking their concerns sincerely and solving them quickly. That way, they would be happy, and would want to stay with you.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">2. Make your customers feel important</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"> To demonstrate this point better, let’s go back to our second situation. By giving your customers some kind of comfort, it makes them feel wanted. By giving them the warmest welcome, chances are, they wouldn’t want to leave. It will elevate your brand by creating an unequalled experience as the furniture with no restrictions like “No sitting.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">With this instance, it makes them feel like they are home, and you being part of their lives. So, think of ways your customers feel that you are for them, and are willing to serve a purpose in their lives.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Though it might be a simple move on your end, when you create a good experience for your customers, it will alter their perception of your brand. Find ways you can build exceptional connections with them. Give them what they want and make them feel important. That way, you just might be </span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"><i>unleavable</i></span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">.</span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"><br/></span></p><h6><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Original article published on <a href=\"Entrepreneur.com\" target=\"\">Entrepreneur.com</a></span>.<br/></h6><p></p>",

     "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;\">The navigation in a large and complex place or wayfinding isn’t an easy job for companies, institutions or organizations. Brainstorming on how to route people to specific areas in a facility is quite laborious, especially in hectic places where people move hastily—like in transportation hubs.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;\">As digital technology is emerging and gradually taking over almost all establishments, it makes for better experiences across industries, including transportation. The traditional signage, such as flags, overhead placards, wall stickers at bus or rail stations and airports are slowly becoming out-dated in the digital age.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;\"><b>Mental clutch</b><br/>In such high-traffic areas, information is very relevant. More importantly, it has to be clear, concise and quick. Passengers are on a rush and would want to see where they should get their ride in a snap. This is what static signage is employed for.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;\">According to research, it takes 8 seconds to clearly and concisely get a message across. Any further than that will get passengers confused and would less probably decide to take public transport.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;\">As these systems are complicated, the job of wayfinding is to simplify and make it easier for passengers to get and process information they need to quickly decide on their actions. It’s a challenge to create substantial messages or content to route them properly and quickly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;\"><b>Digital disruption</b><br/>Going back to the traditional signage (plastic/metal placards, etc.), an issue was seen since it is only static, but has high costs. Moreover, in cases when routes and locations inside a complex area are changed, it would take much work and money to design, create and deploy static signage.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;\">This is an opportunity to disrupt the transportation industry—by going digital. It enables establishments to create stylish and dynamic messages to communicate information that passengers want and need.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;\">Digital signage can be managed remotely, which can feed real-time information to the public. When messages need to be changed, it would be no trouble to load the media content and broadcast it to the network of screens.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;\">With digital and interactive kiosks, messages will be tailored according to what the passenger seeks. Whether it’s a map to the specific terminal gates or a schedule of trips, it’ll cater their query in a shorter time.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #616161;\">Aside from these, more technological devices are available such as mobile phones and digital watches that allow targeted messaging.

The tendency for them to be frustrated is high and would lead them to unsubscribe to the ads.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Action point</span></b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"><b>:</b> Strategise partnerships to reach your target organically.

     "title": "Facial recognition technology saves thousands of lives",
     "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Some developments in technology that we thought were to come in the future or could only exist in our imagination such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars are already a reality. Google’s self-driving car has already driven miles; Tesla’s can drive independently under certain conditions; and by the end of the year, a fully autonomous taxi could be seen running the streets of Singapore.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">As these advancements are focused on the car’s external potentials, such as enabling machines to process and respond to their outside environment, it is equally vital to consider the man in the machine.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">This is what Canberra-based <a href=\"https://www.seeingmachines.com/solutions/\" target=\"\">Seeing Machines </a>seeks to achieve. Hence, they created a camera that can comprehend when drivers are fatigued or distracted. It is said that the solution helped save thousands of lives from accidents.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">A group of roboticists at the Australian National University in 1997 is where the company identifies its roots. Seeing Machine’s director of marketing, Adrian Dean said the researchers were envisioning the “car of the future” and found that it should interact with the passengers inside.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">According to Dean, “The future car would need to understand and relate to the occupants and the driver, in a similar way that a humanoid robot would need to.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">“Understanding the driver was the next step in marrying the two together. Because it is about how the driver is interacting with the robot vehicle, but also so that the autonomous car can understand what the occupants are doing when it’s driving,” he added.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">As laws require a person to sit behind the wheel of a driver-less car, Tesla’s Autopilot requires the person to touch the wheel regularly. This is beneficial once the car is capable of knowing if the person is able to take over, not sleeping, texting or has his attention on something other than driving.<br/></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Understanding the passenger</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">To understand the passenger inside a car, hardware and software were put together by Seeing Machines. They invented a camera that s is attached to the dashboard, and developed algorithms to process the data. It can collect a series of data points from the position of eyes and face to detecting heart rate through the skin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">“We can measure eyelid closure very accurately, which lets us measure and intervene in micro sleeps. There’s also the head pose — whether it’s tilted a certain way. You can understand if someone is looking down at their phone,” says Dean.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">“What we can also detect is where you are looking – using infra-red we detect the glint off your eye to interpret your region of interest. The technology works even if the driver is wearing glasses.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">In the near future the data retrieved could tell the car its passengers’ state and interests. Such technology is still emerging but it is adopted in the mining, aviation and transport industries. It gets data with regards to distractions and micro sleeps, which are causes of accidents.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">With more than 4,000 units sold worldwide, Seeing Machines’ quest of reducing risk has led to good results. It saved thousands of live, whether on the city streets or in mining places.</span></p><!--EndFragment--><h6><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Original article published on <a href=\"www.businessinsider.com.au/innovation-insights-how-this-australian-facial-recognition-business-has-helped-save-thousands-of-lives-2016-4\" target=\"\">www.businessinsider.com.au</a>.

     "description": "<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">The retail industry has revolutionised since the emergence of mobile and e-commerce technologies. From prioritising in-store experience, retailers now want to connect with customers anytime, anywhere. As these and other technologies are rapidly surfacing and transforming how we shop, it is not a far reality that the physical and digital experience will be merged for a better shopping experience. This is where virtual reality (VR) comes into picture.<br/></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Marrying bricks and clicks</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">The physical and digital stores are now coming together to makeover the shopping experience. The big online retailer Amazon opened its physical store as well as other start up online retailers. Similarly, brick and mortar stores invest on e-commerce. Other physical stores display online information on digital screens; an example is Nordstrom’s “top-pinned” items on Pinterest being shown in-store. With this marriage of bricks and clicks shoppers, can shift seamlessly across channels.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"><b>Experiencing the real through the virtual    </b>     </span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">    </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">It’s high time for retailers to experiment on the technology that transports people to different environments without tickets, planes or trains. This is taking the fashion industry to a high-tech platform, which is why big fashion companies like Dior, Balenciaga and Topshop embrace it. Though it takes money and time to build, innovative companies move into this direction to give their customers a new experience.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Another retailer that used VR is the boutique retailer The Line. With the Samsung Gear VR headset, shoppers can tour their store in Manhattan, which is The Apartment. Wherever they are, even halfway around the work, they can still do so with the 3D video technology.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">In the same way, VR developers conducted a demo to Reuters of a customer browsing shoes on a display, picking them, trying them on and purchasing virtually. Such platform aims to study customer preferences to provide personalized experience in-store.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Aside from these, shoppers can also watch the Tommy Hilfiger fall 2015 catwalk show with the same headset. They get to have a 360-degree view and a front row seat at the runway. With a three-dimensional view, the experience will be extraordinary, just like a VIP.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Innovating journeys across industries</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Apart from retail industry, VR has long been developed for gaming. It creates an immersive experience of virtual environments that makes the gaming experience even more enjoyable. Furthermore, in the automotive industry, VR is emerging. Some examples are Audi and Volvo that created virtual showrooms. Without real cars, potential buyers can explore around the holographic car and it features.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">These and many other industries are disrupted by VR. It revolutionises the way we play, shop and live. As it has given optimistic responses, it is expected that VR will continue to transform experiences. For example, creating a virtual model of yourself or other people that you can use to try on clothes on. The virtual is becoming a reality, giving an exceptional shopping experience. Imagine what more it can do.

     "description": "<p><span class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" id=\"selectionBoundary_1474851414499_3179486971185611\"></span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Digital technology is growing exponentially and is becoming a part of the day-to-day lives of people globally. In highly urbanised cities, this is all too evident. Wherever you look, you’ll see smartphones, televisions and computers. This trend has been out for a while now, but unlike other trends, this isn’t going away any time soon, as sales show. In this age of digitising almost everything, tech innovators aren’t just biting into what’s in. They continuously seek for techniques for their products to have some human element. This way, digital devices won’t only take our time of day, but also make our lives better.</span></p><p><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Modern day watches</span></b></p><p><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">The watch that we used to know, the one with a dial, gears and hands, are at risk of becoming a thing of the past. It is digitised as well, which is why we have smartwatches today. It can display a preview of messages on your cellphone, measure your steps, control the music you play, and a lot more.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">With capabilities to do more than just tell time, it is highly regarded in the retail industry to create a better customer experience. Its smart features can get data of customers in store to give them better offerings tailored for them. Also, it could be possible for them to pay at the checkout counters with the smartwatch.</span></p><p><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Outselling traditional timepieces</span></b></p><p><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Previously, the sales of analogue watches always surpassed that of the smartwatches. We always want what’s classic. However, in the recent Strategy Analytics (Q4 2015), global smartwatch shipments reached 8.1 million. Compared to 7.9 million Swiss Watches, the digital form has outdone the classic watch for the first time.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Despite being thought earlier as just a fad, smartwatches are here to stay, and grow. It wouldn’t replace traditional watches, but it is a good area of development and digitisation. It is a good trend of upcoming innovation.</span></p><p><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Enhancing the human element</span></b></p><p><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">The rollout of smartwatches has been successful because it disrupted a platform that is classic and has long been existing. It found a way to put in its power and style that created a unique need from the products that it digitised. It has appealed to the users to have something smart, functional and stylish at the same time.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">This inclination is a good sign for digital signage in the retail and other industries. By seeing the movement of modern technology combined with the human element, it might lead to better engagement. As the smartwatch’s success is credited to its human element of making lives better and easier, the future of other technologies, such as digital signage are looking up as well. Thus, capitalising on the human element can captivate customers.</span></p><h6><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Original article and photo published on <a href=\"http://www.digitalsocialretail.com/smartwatch-sales-point-to-a-new-trend-in-digitization/\" target=\"\">digitalsocialretail.com</a>.</span></h6><!--EndFragment--><p></p><p><span class=\"rangySelectionBoundary\" id=\"selectionBoundary_1474851414499_5361761584261739\"></span></p>",

     "description": "<p><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">It’s obvious that more and more technological innovations are surfacing. It’s the age of digitising almost everything; from watches, menu boards, shopping, and to just about anything! Similarly, advertising is moving towards the same direction.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Now, if you’re in doubt about going digital, try asking yourself these questions:</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Is my business eco-conscious?</span></li><li><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Do I want to reach consumers from streets and other high traffic outdoors?</span></li><li><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Will digital help me improve my brand position compared to print?</span></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">If you’ve got a ‘yes’ to those three, it’s high time for you to bank on something that will not only help your business, but also preserve the precious and only planet that we have. Wanna know more? Just read on and find out the wonder of digital signage.<br/></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Digital signage holds the upper hand versus print advertising</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Try picturing this: you have 1500 posters to be printed which took you 2-3 days conceptualizing and printing. It tells about your latest collection for the summer season, and, as it turns out, there are some mistakes in your design that you’ve overlooked and it’s now on your final material. It is too much hassle to fix your design and have it printed again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">With the above example alone, you already have wasted things; time and money. Okay, let’s spice up situation a bit more. You’ll have to pay people to install them around high traffic areas. That’s a lot of money for one roll out. Then, the summer season ended, another pain in your pocket.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Digital signage, however, lets you increase you advertising value while avoiding these costs, and stop using so much materials to reduce waste. Therefore, it has the upper hand in the war for eco-friendliness. Although it’s not 100% eco-friendly, digital signage is the wiser choice because hardware replacement isn’t always done.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">But then paper is recyclable, which is eco-friendly<br/></span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">You may argue and say that paper can be recycled, and can do well to our environment, but it is a long and arduous process which has to be done repeatedly. For example, the replacement of print material is on a weekly or monthly basis, which is a bit too harmful. This is because the transport, recycling and the whole process of putting up your print ads require the use of trucks or cars, which emits harmful gases.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Though deploying digital signage may require a lot of energy as well, modern digital displays are optimised to use less energy and last longer, avoiding e-wastes on landfills. This helps avoid long-term environmental impacts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">You and digital signage: a partnership of the future</span></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Instead of using lots of paper and ink and exerting so much work with print ads, it is a reasonable step to go digital. Put in mind how much paper you could save and the impact your business can have on the environment. You would want to position your brand as eco-friendly and increase up time, all while reducing production time and costs.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">As digital signage can be managed remotely and assets can be changed quickly without going on site, it is the better choice that can benefit your company in the long run.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Environment concerns are slowly becoming rampant and it’s likely for stricter environmental guidelines to be implemented. It might require businesses to measure and lessen harmful impacts down the line. This might sound “preachy” to you, but it is a real concern, which your brand needs to consider.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Digital signage will be a big shift in your advertising and brand awareness. It will not only captivate outdoor consumers, manage media conveniently and create stylish and dynamic messaging, but laso lets you have a significant and positive impact to the environment.</span><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\"><br/></span></p><h6><span style=\"color: #616161;background-color: #ffffff;\">Original article published on <a href=\"digitalsignagetoday.com\" target=\"\">digitalsignagetoday.com</a>.</span><br/></h6>",
